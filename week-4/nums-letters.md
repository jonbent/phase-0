####What does `puts` do?   
`puts` outputs to the terminal whatever follows it; or according to DBC's explanation: `puts` returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line.   

####What is an integer? What is a float?   
An integer is any number without a decimal point and a float is any number with a decimal point.   

####What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?   
Integer division returns integers and float division will return a float.  If you where to divide 9/2 using float division you would get 4.5 or 4 with a remainder of 5. With integer division there is no remainder so the number is rounded down. So with the above example of 9/2, using integer division the answer would be 4.   
####Hours in a year
```ruby
puts 24 * 365
```   
####Minutes in a decade   
```ruby
puts (60 * 24) * ((365 * 10) + 2)
```

####How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?   
Ruby handles basic arithmetic in the following way:
  * __Addition:__ uses the `+` symbol   
  * __Subtraction:__ uses the `-` symbol   
  * __Multiplication:__ uses the `*` symbol
  * __Division:__ uses the `\` symbol   

####What is the difference between integers and floats?   
An integer is any number without a decimal point, while a float is any number with a decimal point.   

####What is the difference between integer and float division?   
Integer division returns integers and float division will return a float.   

####What are strings? Why and when would you use them?   
Strings are a group of characters in a program that are surrounded in either `''` or `""`. Strings are used to define non-integer and non-float variables.   

####What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?   
Variables store strings, integers, floats, etc. into the computers memory so the stored value can be recalled.   

####How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?   
Although this challenge was somewhat simple, it was a good refresher to the basics of Ruby. Having done my pairing session prior to the rest of the weeks challenges proved to be difficult. Had I worked on everything in order, I feel that I would have had a better understanding of the basics.

What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
It is important to add a <link> tag in the header of the HTML file when linking to an external stylesheet. You must also add the relative link to the stylesheet within the link.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
We used a combination of margin and padding to adjust the positioning of the elements. Without looking at the actual source code, it is alway difficult to get a pixel perfect rendition. It basically comes down to trial and error until you get something that looks similar.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
The CSS we used to modify the element styles like size, color, etc was:
.element {
  text-size: 10px; (changes the size of the text)
  color: #ff0000; (changes the color of the text to red)
  background-color: #ffffff; (changes the background color to white)
}

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We chose to include classes to the existing HTML, primarily because classes can be reused eliminating some repetition.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
Obviously the site we created is cleaner and follows best practice. Not only was our HTML mark-up more up-to-date, but we did not include in-line css.

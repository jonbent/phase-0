<!--
  What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    Fortunately, I have done a lot with HTML. In my current job, as a visual designer, I have created websites and HTML email campaigns. But having a refresher is always a good thing!

  How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    Again, I have used the new HTML5 markup extensively so I didn't need to look up anything. Although, I always seem to forget the HTML codes for special characters, so I did look up the code for the registered mark.

  How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    Typically I am always creating my classes and ids as I'm writing my HTML. Although, the nice thing about just doing the HTML markup is that it makes creating classes and ids easier. It gives you time to see how and what you want styled and I tend to not be as repetitive in my CSS markup.

  What seems good and bad about HTML?
    Obviously, HTML is the backbone or foundation of a website so that is a good thing about HTML. The bad thing is without any CSS it looks dated and unprofessional.

  What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    EMMET for Sublime Text! It makes formatting so much faster. Beyond that, remember to close your tags.

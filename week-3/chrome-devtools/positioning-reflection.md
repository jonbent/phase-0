####How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
You can use Chrome's DevTools inspector to instantly affect the DOM of an HTML file to reflect formatting and CSS changes. This allows you to visual see the changes you are making. Because it is only temporary and refreshing the page removes any formatting you can easily reset any changes you made. Also, highlighting an element in the DOM will show the elements dimensions so you can see if there is any margin or padding on the element.

####How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
By selecting the element in the DOM you can add or change the CSS width and height attributes of the element.

####What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

**Absolute:** Is positioned relative to its parent element.
**Fixed:** Will fix the element within the web browser. You can adjust the position using top, left, right, or bottom; but the element will stay in that position even if the page is scrolled.
**Static:** Is the default type of positioning for any element.
**Relative:** Is relative to itself and can be positioned using top, left, right, or bottom. Adjusting any of these attributes will change the position of the element with the position set to relative without effecting any other element.

I guess I would say the fixed and relative are fairly easy to use, and I seem to always have troubles with absolute.

####What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
If you think of an HTML element as a box, margin is the space around the outside of the box. This affects the spacing in-between one element and another, but does not change the physical size of the box. You can think of border as the thickness of the box's walls and padding as the space in-between the box wall and the item within the box. Unlike margin, both border and padding have an affect on the size of the box. Border will actually increase the size of the box, while padding reduces the size of the box's interior. So if your interior width was 50px and you had padding of 10px on both the left and right side the actual interior space of your box would only be 30px.

####What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
Learning positioning is always a difficult concept to grasp. This challenge was helpful because it allows you to visually see how changing the position of an element effects the element and the other elements around it.

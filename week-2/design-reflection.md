**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**
My site is primarily a portfolio site for potential employers. It will feature current and past projects as well as an ongoing blog of my development as a developer.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**
My target audience's interest is finding out about me and my skill sets. Using creative and visual elements, as well as clear navigational paths, I plan to make it easy for potential employers or other visitors to get a click overview of who I am and what I am capable of achieving.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio?** *It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.*
The primary "action" the user should take when coming to my site in seeing my portfolio.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
The thing about design and user experience is that they are both subjective. One person may find a specific design pleasing while another may find it distracting. In the same way the experience that those two users have can, and most likely will, be different. Good design, however, incorporates the fundamentals of good UX design.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?** 
User experience design focuses on how an individual feels while using a website or application. It is valuable because a site or application that is easy and pleasing to use can lead to greater sales or increased dwell time on your site. You could have the greatest designed site with all the "cool" and "hip" elements, but if your site isn't easy to navigate then people will get frustrated and leave.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
Writing the reflection.

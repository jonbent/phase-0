#1.1 Think About Time
I am a procrastinator by heart. I can think of a million things I want to do rather than focusing on the task that I have to do. The idea of counter-intuitive productivity fascinated me. Although while researching this form of time management, I realized that this is probably not the best approach for me.

Instead of working on a task until completion, with "Time Boxing" you set a limited time frame to work on a task and then evaluate how much was of the task was completed. By working within a construct like this, you start to develop a better sense of how long a task will actually take.

As I stated earlier, I am a procrastinator and currently I don't really manage my time. I remember in school teachers would say to spend a little amount of time working on a paper or a project over a period of time so it doesn't seem so overwhelming. However, whenever I have tried this approach I ran into the problem that I was unable to continue with a certain train of thought and my work seemed schizophrenic. So currently I seem to put everything off until the very last minute so I force myself to focus on completing the task at hand.

Of course my current strategy of time management is not really that effective. It puts a tremendous amount of undue stress on me and makes even the simplest of tasks seem overwhelming and unachievable; making me put off completing the task.

I feel that "Time Boxing" may be the best strategy for me to implement. Not only does it mirror more what you would find in an "Agile" work environment, but I feel that it will help me focus on the task at hand.

Phase 0 is the scariest part of DBC for me. Because of my inability to effectively manage my time without a lot of undue stress, I really need to figure out a practical way of managing my work/learning/personal life; a feat that I have yet to accomplish in my 45 years. This week was difficult to try and put a real plan into effect as I had so much personal things that was competing with DBC. In the upcoming weeks I plan on working at least 2 hours a night M - F and all day on Saturday and Sunday. I will try to incorporate "Time Boxing" and working in spurts as opposed to trying to plow through everything in one sitting.

#1.2 The Command Line
Shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands and "bash" is the default shell.

I am a visual person and learner because of that working in the command line has always seemed very difficult to me. Because of this it sometimes takes longer for me to visual wrap my head around everything that is happening.

Although even with my difficulties visualizing everything that was happening when I was using the commands, I was still able to successfully use them all.

When it comes to the command line, I am reminded of Spiderman, "with great power there must also come great responsibility!" The command line is such a powerful tool that truly allows you to accomplish almost anything on a computer that I don't feel that there is really one command or argument that is more powerful that another. Although with that being said, I do feel that with the information that was presented the ability to move within an create directories is at this point in the learning process one of the more useful commands.

-pwd = print working directory

-ls = list directory

-mv = move directory/file

-cd = change directory

-../ = move up one level in the directory

-touch = create an empty file

-mkdir = make a directory

-less = page through a file

-rmdir = remove a directory

-rm = remove a file

-help = gets information about the commands

#1.4 Forking and Cloning
Creating a repository on GitHub is easy.

 1. Navigate to your GitHub profile.
 2. Click on the *+* in the upper right corner of the navigation bar.
 3. Select *New Repository*.
 4. Name your repository.
 5. Select Public or Private.
 6. Add a license.
 7. Click *Create Repository* button, and you're done!

Forking a repository on GitHub is just as easy.

 1. Navigate to the public repository you would like to fork.
 2. Click the *Fork* button in the upper right corner, and you're done!

Cloning a GitHub repository to your computer is easy too.

 1. Select the repository you would like to clone from your profile page.
 2. In the menu on the right chose whether you would like to clone using HTTPS or SSH.
 3. Click the *Copy to Clipboard* button, and switch to your Terminal application.
 4. In terminal navigate to the directory you would like to clone the repository.
 5. Type *git clone* and paste in the code you copied to your clipboard. Hit *Return* and you're done!
 
Forking a repository allows you to clone and work on an existing repository to your computer without directly effecting the existing repository. This makes more sense than creating a new repository when you will be working on existing code.

Fortunately, I have used git and GitHub previously so I did not run into any challenges, but it was a good refresher to have seeing how I have not done it in awhile.

#### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Creating a repository on GitHub and cloning the repository to your local computer is easy, even for a non-technical person!
 1. Go to your profile page at https://github.com
 2. Click on the "+" in the upper right corner of the navigation bar. *(Hint it's in-between the Notification Icon and your profile Avatar)*
 3. Select *New Repository* from the drop down menu
 4. Enter a name for your new repository
 5. Choose whether you want your repository Public (anyone can see this repository but you choose who can commit) or Private (you choose who can see and commit to the repository)
 6. Check if you want to initialize the repository with a README file
 7. Select if you want to add a license
 8. Click the green *Create repository* button, and you're done!

Now that you have a new repository on GitHub we need to clone (add it) to your computer and that is really easy too!
 1. On the right side of your repository is a menu, there you will see HTTPS clone URL
 2. Click the *Copy to clipboard* button and close GitHub
 3. Open your Terminal application *(The easy way to do this on a Mac is to hold command and space bar,  this opens the Spotlight Search. Start typing Terminal and hit *return*)
 4. With the Terminal now open type **git clone** and then command-v to paste the code from your clipboard, and you're done!

#### Describe what open source means.
Open source means that anyone can view and edit the source code of a program.

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Like anything there is a time and place for open source and it is not applicable for every situation. The advantage of open source software is that it can grow at an accelerated rate, with new ideas and features being added to the original program. With tools like git and GitHub, open source software now has the ability to regulate and control who can make changes and what changes will actually be incorporated into the original program. Because of this, open source software is not safer and offers a greater level of protection. There are many programs that I use that are or have been created as open source programs. Open source software does feel somewhat of Utopian idea, in which the collaborative efforts of developers helps create useful and meaningful software.

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.
The importance of using licenses is to protect the inherent copyright associated with creating the original software.

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenge really helped to solidify the process of creating a branch and using a pull request to merge the branch into the master branch.

#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Having created web pages and websites before, this particular challenge didn't require any additional research above and beyond the information provided.
